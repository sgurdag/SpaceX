Implement SpaceX rocket launches informative application
As a user, I want to see the list of rockets, when I open the application

● For each rocket in the list the next attributes should be displayed: name, country and
engines count <br/>
● When the application is opened for the first time it should display a welcome dialog <br/>
● As a user, I want to have possibility to filter the list and see only active rockets. <br/>
(Parameter “active” should be used for filtering data)

The application should display a loading indicator if it is fetching data. The application should allow a user to refresh the data.

The application should use Open Source REST API that can be found here:
